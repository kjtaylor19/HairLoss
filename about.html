    <h1>About Children With Hair Loss</h1>
    <p>Children With Hair Loss is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization that provides human hair replacements at no cost to children and young adults facing medically-related hair loss.  When a child's hair is lost due to Cancer treatments, Alopecia, Trichotillomania, Burns, etc., the painful effects are far deeper than just cosmetic.  Each year, the number of children requesting our hair replacements increases and with your support, we can continue to increase the number of children we are able to help in the future!</p>

    <h2>Our History</h2>

    <p>CWHL opened in September 2000. After researching, we didn’t find any other organizations that were giving human hair replacements to children at no cost. CWHL’s mission and goals were to never charge a family at a time when they need the most help. After years of intense fund raising, CWHL was able to purchase their first building in 2005. The headquarters resides in South Rockwood, Michigan in an old renovated fire station. Originally, CWHL’s focus was on children fighting cancer, until we found out that there were a lot of other reasons why children lost hair including Alopecia, burns, Trichotillomania and other rare diseases and disorders. To this day, Children With Hair Loss has never charged a child. Currently, we provide a customized human hair replacement and care kit to over 300 children a year!</p>

    <h2>Our Founder</h2>

    <p>Regina Villemure, a former cosmetology instructor, hairstylist and hair replacement specialist with a master certification with the American Hair Loss Council, brings years of hair industry experience to Children With Hair Loss.</p>

    <p>Regina founded CWHL after her niece, Sarah, was diagnosed with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at age three. Sarah underwent chemotherapy for five years, and is now a survivor of more than 30 years.</p>

    <p>Throughout Sarah's treatments, Regina saw many children in the hospital who had lost their hair or who were wearing adult-sized synthetic wigs. With her hair industry experience, Regina knew that human hair replacements look the most natural on children, but also that they are very expensive. She realized that most families were unable to afford them, and she wanted to help! She immediately made it her mission to "Cover Young Heads to Heal Young Hearts."™</p>
